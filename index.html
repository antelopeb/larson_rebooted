			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is <strong>Greg Davis</strong>, and I make things. I make all sorts of things. Sometimes those things are physical and personal, like cabinets or ukuleles. Most of the time, they are software products for the companies that I work for.</p>
			<p>I'm a passionate <strong>User Experience</strong> developer, designer and leader. My work has spanned the gamut, from platform level application development and design, to narrative content and ePub development, to individual websites. I work hand-in-hand with Editorial, Product Managers, Program Mangers, software engineers, UX researchers and anyone else on the team, to produce high-quality, user driven software products. I have worked in Agile development teams, run agile development teams myself and I'm constantly working in an iterative, forward thinking way.</p>
			<p>If I could summarize myself and my philosophy, it would be short and simple: <strong>design/prototype, test, iterate</strong>.</p>

				<h3>Manager of UX Prototyping<br />
				Pearson PLC: 2013–current</h3>
				<p>My primary responsibility in this position is to supply prototyping services to the User Experience team in Higher Education. I hired and lead a small team of prototypers and work hand-in-hand with product managers, content editors, program managers, engineering teams and designers to build prototypes that are used for a user research and ultimately inform the final software product released to the public.</p>
				<p>The team is also responsible for working directly with the publishing arm of the company for producing early prototypes of next-generation content, as well as managing the development of SASS based content themes, interactive widgets, ePub3 documents and more.</p>
				<p>In this position I've developed platform specific strategies for SASS development and themeing, as well as helping to lead the UX of products and content from the earliest stages. Products I've worked on or the team has worked on include REVEL, Pearson Collections, Work Sampling Online, and more, including many that are in active development.</p>
